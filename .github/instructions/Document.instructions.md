description: Write descriptive comments on powershell scripts to explain the purpose of each section and important lines of code. This will help other developers (or your future self) understand the logic and flow of the script when they read it later.

- Add comments at the beginning of each script to provide an overview of what the script does, its inputs and outputs, and any important notes about its usage.
- For complex sections of code, add inline comments to explain the logic and reasoning behind the implementation. This is especially important for any non-obvious code or workarounds.
- Use comments to break down the script into logical sections, making it easier to navigate and understand the overall structure.
- If there are any external dependencies or required configurations (e.g., environment variables, API keys), document these clearly in the comments at the top of the script.
- When updating existing scripts, review the comments to ensure they are still accurate and relevant. Update them as needed to reflect any changes in the code or functionality.
- Always use british English for comments (e.g., "optimise" instead of "optimize", "colour" instead of "color").
